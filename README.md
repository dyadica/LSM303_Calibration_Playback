LSM303_Calibration_Playback
===========================

The LSM303 Breakout is a nice little compass module that consists of a triple axis accelerometer and a triple axis magnetometer. When used together this combination of sensors allows the LSM303 to perform 6D orientation detection and provide all the data needed to calculate a tilt-compensated heading.

This code is an Arduino sketch that allows both calibration of the LSM303 and the saving of calibration data to the arduino’s EEPROM.

As always the code is fully commented and it will be hopefully easy for you to understand what’s going on etc.. Please be aware however, that in order to use the code you will first also need to download the Pololu library from:
